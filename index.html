        <p>
            I am a recent Mobile and Smart Systems graduate from the University of Hertfordshire achieving a first class. I have developed an analytical mind and good communication skills through completing a variety of university projects, in addition I work well on deadline. I am now seeking to utilise these skills in the technology sector.

        <h3>PROJECTS</h3>
            <h4>Final Year Project, Pedestrian Detection System</h4> 
            <ul>
                <li>Developed a computer vision-based application that recognises pedestrians from the POV of a carâ€™s dashcam.</li>
                <li>Created a structured plan of action using a Gantt Chart, met all deadlines and completed project in good time as a result.</li>
                <li>Programmed in Python 3 using the TensorFlow framework</li>
                <li>Researched and implemented A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)</li>
                <li>Applied transfer learning, took a pre-trained model (SSD) and repurposed it for the Caltech Pedestrian dataset and returned a loss of 5.67</li>
                <li>Achieved a mean average precision (mAP) of 43% initially, but readjusted the learning rate on training which increased the mAP to 56%</li>
            </ul>


        <br><br>

        <h4>Workout Generator</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>Wrote a program to create workouts that get progressively get more difficult, made for personal use.</li>
            <li>Programmed in Python </li>
            <li>Users can enter weights they can currently lift on certain exercises (1 rep max) and the application will return a 4-week workout routine</li>
            <li>Users get shown which workouts to do on which day, how many sets and reps and the rate they should be increasing the weights</li>
            <li>Application also shows user which size plates they need to use for a set</li> 
         </ul>
                       
        <br><br>

        <h4>The Laptop Shop</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>A GUI application which stores information on laptops and features that would useful for customers</li>
            <li>WPF application programmed in C#</li>
            <li>Created an SQL database and stored laptop information (Model, Price, Manufacturer, RAM, etc.)</li>
            <li>Implemented a search feature so users could search by any feature they wanted, added filters upon being reviewed by peers (e.g. sort by RAM)</li>
            <li>Insert and delete commands could be executed via buttons on the interface to easily manipulate database</li>
        </ul>
